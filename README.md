# Machine Learning Self-Learning Notes

Welcome to my repository for keeping notes as I self-learn machine learning. This repository serves as my personal learning log where I document concepts, techniques, and insights gained from various resources.

## Resources

I am following the [DataTalksClub Machine Learning Zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/machine-learning-zoomcamp) repository and accompanying videos. These resources provide a structured and comprehensive approach to understanding and applying machine learning.

## Contents

Each topic folder contains Markdown files with detailed explanations, examples, and key takeaways.

## How to Use

Feel free to browse through the notes. Each file is designed to be a standalone document, so you can jump into any topic that interests you.

## Contributing

This repository is primarily for my personal use, but I welcome suggestions and improvements. If you have any ideas or feedback, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
