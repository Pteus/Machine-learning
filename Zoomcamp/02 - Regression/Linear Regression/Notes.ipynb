    "Linear regression is a powerful tool for predicting numerical values based on input features. By finding the best-fitting linear equation, it enables us to make accurate predictions and gain insights into the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with a simple form of linear regression, using only one observation (or one row of the feature matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "We take as an example the characteristics `engine_hp`, `city_mpg`, and `popularity`:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_i = [138, 24, 1385] $\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ve just implemented the formula as mentioned before with the given values:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 7.17 + 138 \\cdot 0.01 + 24 \\cdot 0.04 + 1385 \\cdot 0.002 = 12.28 $\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ w_0 = 7.17 $ : bias term - the prediction of a car's price if we don’t know anything about it\n",
    "- `engine_hp`: $ 138 \\cdot 0.01 $ - for every 100 hp, the price will increase by `$`1\n",
    "- `city_mpg`: $ 24 \\cdot 0.04 $ - similar to hp, the higher the mpg, the higher the price\n",
    "- `popularity`: $ 1385 \\cdot 0.002 $ - although it affects the price, each extra mention on website only slightly increases the car's price\n",
    "\n",
    "There is still one important step to do. Because we applied a logarithmic transformation (log(y+1)) to the price at the beginning, we now have to undo that transformation to get the predicted price in dollars. Our car has a predicted price of `$`215,344.72.\n"
