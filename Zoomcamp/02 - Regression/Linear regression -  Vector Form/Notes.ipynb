    "# Improving Our Linear Regression Formula\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we had the formula for our linear regression as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ g(x_i) = w_0 + \\sum w_j \\cdot w_{ij} $\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula was only considering one observation. By looking at the last part of this formula, we see the dot product (vector-vector multiplication):\n",
    "\n",
    "$ g(x_i) = w_0 + x_i^T w $\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's implement the dot product (vector-vector multiplication) again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def dot(xi, w):\n",
    "    n = len(xi)\n",
    "    res = 0.0\n",
    "    for j in range(n):\n",
    "        res = res + xi[j] * w[j]\n",
    "    return res\n",
    "```\n",
    "Based on that, the implementation of the `linear_regression` function could look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def linear_regression(xi):\n",
    "    return w0 + dot(xi, w)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the last equation more simple, we can imagine there is one more feature $ x_{i0} $ that is always equal to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "$ g(x_i) = w_0 + x_i^T w \\rightarrow g(x_i) = w_0 x_{i0} + x_i^T w $\n",
    "\n",
    "That means the vector \\( w \\) becomes an \\( n+1 \\) dimensional vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w = [w_0, w_1, w_2, \\ldots, w_n] $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x_i = [x_{i0}, x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{in}] = [1, x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \\ldots, x_{in}] $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w^T x_i = x_i^T w = w_0 + \\ldots $\n",
    "\n",
    "Having done this, letâ€™s go back to thinking about all the examples together.\n",
    "\n",
    "$X$ is an $m \\times (n+1)$ dimensional matrix (with $m$ rows and  $n+1$ columns)."
